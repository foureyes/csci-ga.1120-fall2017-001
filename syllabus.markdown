The class will meet weekly for 2.5 hours, with a mix of lecture, discussions of readings, and project-based work.

There will be weekly office hours available, as well as weekly tutoring sessions with the course grader/tutor.

A platform will be provided for asking questions online as well as moderating discussions among students.

This course introduces students to the fundamentals of computer programming as students design, write, and debug computer programs using the programming language Python.

Students will learn how to design algorithms to solve problems and how to translate these algorithms into working computer programs. Students acquire skills and experience as they learn Python through programming assignments with an approach that integrates project-based learning. This course is an introduction to the fundamental concepts of programming for students who lack a formal background in the field. 

Topics include algorithm design and program development; data types; control structures; functions and parameter passing; recursion; data structures; searching and sorting; and an introduction to the principles of object- oriented programming. The primary programming language used in the course will be Python. 

No prerequisite

* About __one project__ every __week__
* Projects will reinforce programming topics learned in class by exploring various practical applications of programming
* Some possible project themes may include (depending on time available and interest from class): 
    * textual analysis and textual manipulations
    * interpreting and visualizing data
    * retrieving and processing data from the web
    * working with images and basic image analysis
    * creating and manipulating sound 
* All projects should be turned in __electronically__ via __NYU Classes__
* Projects will usually be __due one week after posting__
* Project submission will stay open up to 24 hours after the due date in NYU classes
* After the 24 hour grace period, projects cannot be submitted
* A consistent pattern of projects submitted during the grace period will result in a penalty
* You must __write your own code__ 
    * (don't copy other students' work, solutions found online, etc.)
    * Do not distribute your code
    * However, helping students by debugging or discussing high-level parts of the project is allowed
